# AVR_Drivers
### This repository contains drivers for the AVR ATmega32 microcontroller. The drivers are divided into three directories:

- MCAL: This directory contains drivers for the AVR ATmega32's Microcontroller Abstraction Layer. The drivers included in this directory are:
    * ADC
    * GPIO
    * i2C
    * ICU
    * SPI
    * Timer
    * USART
    
    
- HAL: This directory contains drivers for the AVR ATmega32's Hardware Abstraction Layer. The drivers included in this directory are:

    * Button
    * Buzzer
    * EEPROM
    * Keypad
    * LCD
    * Motors
    * Sensors
    * Seven_Segment
    
    
- Utils: This directory contains commonly used macros and standard types used by the drivers.

Feel free to use these drivers in your AVR ATmega32 projects. If you encounter any issues or have any suggestions, please create an issue on this repository.
